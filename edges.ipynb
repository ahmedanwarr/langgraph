    "Edges define how the logic is routed and how the graph decides to stop. This is a big part of how your agents work and how different nodes communicate with each other. There are a few key types of edges:\n",

    "Normal Edges: Go directly from one node to the next.\n",

    "### Send\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, Nodes and Edges are defined ahead of time and operate on the same shared state. However, there can be cases where the exact edges are not known ahead of time and/or you may want different versions of State to exist at the same time. A common example of this is with map-reduce design patterns. In this design pattern, a first node may generate a list of objects, and you may want to apply some other node to all those objects. The number of objects may be unknown ahead of time (meaning the number of edges may not be known) and the input State to the downstream Node should be different (one for each generated object).\n",
    "\n",
    "To support this design pattern, LangGraph supports returning Send objects from conditional edges. Send takes two arguments: first is the name of the node, and second is the state to pass to that node."
